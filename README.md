# CS210Project
My third CS210 project for submission
Direction: "One of Python's strengths is its ability to search through text and process large amounts of data, so that programming language will be used to manage internal functions of the program you create. Alternatively, C++ will be used to interface with users who are interested in using the prototype tracking program."
This is my project submission with the cpp files for the C++ portion and the functions for the python portion to call upon the list of groceries I had on a separate txt file.

README update:
- This project did the mentioned above and had the implementation of python and C++ to work together in a cohesive project.
- I feel that my use of the python functions is improving and becoming my strong suit, and have had the most success in developing. I hope to use more advanced methods and start learning and applying more complicated tasks and one day automation.
- I could definately use more practice in the C++ category as that took much more of my research time and was still my most struggled with part of this whole project.
- I had the most trouble figuring out how to tie both of the languages to work together. There were many parts I was able to get help with through peers as well as youtube guides and stack overflow was great in aiding those very specific questions on wrong inputs on my end. Having other eyes on my code helped me see my mistakes.
- I know for a fact that all this research into combining languages will be a recurring task and I will definitely be using that moving forward so I am glad to have been assigned this early on. 
- I tried my best to not overcomplicate the written code portions, and tried to make it more readable by following code structure and comment syntax. I did my best to allign comments with the functions and goals of the code written or changed.
