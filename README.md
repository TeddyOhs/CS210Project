# CS210Project
My third CS210 project for submission
Direction: "One of Python's strengths is its ability to search through text and process large amounts of data, so that programming language will be used to manage internal functions of the program you create. Alternatively, C++ will be used to interface with users who are interested in using the prototype tracking program."
This is my project submission with the cpp files for the C++ portion and the functions for the python portion to call upon the list of groceries I had on a separate txt file.
